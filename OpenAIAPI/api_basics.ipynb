    "text = \"Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL.US) has demonstrated a strong focus on expanding its AI capabilities, notably with the introduction of its advanced AI model, Gemini, aimed at enhancing its suite of products and services [reported on December 6]. The company's financial health remains robust, with significant earnings growth and a solid net cash position, despite facing legal and regulatory challenges, including an antitrust case loss to Epic Games [reported on December 12] and a $700M antitrust ruling [reported on December 19]. Alphabet's strategic investments in AI, such as the launch of Gemini and the development of proprietary AI hardware like the TPU v5p chip, underscore its commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the tech industry [reported in January].Factual news highlights Alphabet's continued dominance in the tech sector, with a 57% stock increase in 2023 and a PEG ratio of 1.4, signaling strong investment potential [reported on 2024-01-01]. The company's Q4 earnings report exceeded Wall Street estimates, with a revenue of $72.32 billion, marking a 14.6% increase year-over-year [reported on 2024-01-30]. Despite this, Alphabet faces challenges, including a slowdown in Google Cloud's growth [reported on 2024-01-22] and scrutiny over privacy rights concerning Google search data [reported on 2024-01-05].Analysts' opinions are generally optimistic about Alphabet's future, particularly due to its AI advancements and strategic positioning in digital advertising and cloud computing. The company's AI model, Gemini, is expected to significantly enhance Google search results and create new revenue streams [reported on 2024-01-27]. Despite potential short-term volatility, Alphabet's strategic investments in AI and its strong financial performance position it as a compelling investment for 2024 [reported on 2024-01-06]. However, there are concerns about the immediate monetization potential of generative AI and the impact of regulatory challenges on Alphabet's competitive dynamics [reported on 2024-01-17].In summary, Alphabet Inc Class A continues to innovate and expand its reach in the tech industry, with a strong focus on AI and cloud computing. The company's financial health is solid, and it remains a popular choice among investors. However, ongoing legal and regulatory challenges, along with the need to effectively monetize its AI advancements, could impact its future performance.\"\n",

      "Creating a thread system from scratch in C without relying on any pre-existing threading libraries (like pthreads on POSIX systems) is a complex task and involves in-depth understanding of operating system internals. However, it's worth noting that without using specific system calls provided by the operating system—in which these system calls themselves constitute a \"library\" of sorts—it is practically impossible to implement true multithreading solely with standard, portable C.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, I'll guide you through the concept of how you might approach this challenge at a very high level, particularly focusing on simulating the concept of threads and a simple scheduler on a single-threaded process. We will not be able to achieve true parallel execution as you would with native threads, but I can show a concept similar to cooperative multitasking, where \"threads\" voluntarily yield control to allow others to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the constraints, the closest we can get is by manually managing execution flows within a single process, mimicking the behavior of threads. This will not be truly concurrent or parallel execution and also we'll bypass the limitation by not using any real \"thread\" but simulating a context switch mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Concept Overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reserve Space for Thread Context**: Manually reserve space for each \"thread\" context, including the stack and the instruction pointer emulation.\n",
      "2. **Context Switch Mechanism**: Implement a simple context switch mechanism to switch between these manually managed \"threads\".\n",
      "3. **Cooperative Multitasking**: Since preemptive multitasking (true parallelism) requires system-level support, we'll rely on cooperative multitasking where each \"thread\" runs for a bit then yields control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Steps Explained\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Thread Context Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "```c\n",
      "typedef struct ThreadContext {\n",
      "    uint8_t* stackPointer;  // Emulate stack pointer\n",
      "    // Add more elements as needed, like instruction pointer if you can emulate it\n",
      "} ThreadContext;\n",
      "\n",
      "#define STACK_SIZE 1024  // Example stack size\n",
      "uint8_t stack1[STACK_SIZE];\n",
      "uint8_t stack2[STACK_SIZE];\n",
      "\n",
      "ThreadContext thread1, thread2;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Context Switch Mechanism\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assembly and system-level operations, a true context switch (saving and restoring registers, stack pointers, etc.) is beyond plain C's capabilities. However, we can simulate a cooperative switch with function calls and a simple scheduler.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Creating \"Threads\" and Scheduler\n",
      "\n",
      "```c\n",
      "void scheduler();\n",
      "void threadFunction1();\n",
      "void threadFunction2();\n",
      "\n",
      "int currentThread = 0;\n",
      "\n",
      "void setupThreads() {\n",
      "    thread1.stackPointer = stack1 + STACK_SIZE;  // Imagine this points to the top of the stack\n",
      "    thread2.stackPointer = stack2 + STACK_SIZE;\n",
      "    \n",
      "    // Normally, you'd set up instruction pointers etc., here too\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "void scheduler() {\n",
      "    switch (currentThread) {\n",
      "        case 0:\n",
      "            currentThread = 1;\n",
      "            threadFunction1();\n",
      "            break;\n",
      "        case 1:\n",
      "            currentThread = 0;\n",
      "            threadFunction2();\n",
      "            break;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "void threadFunction1() {\n",
      "    // Do some work\n",
      "    printf(\"Thread 1 running\\n\");\n",
      "    // cooperative yielding\n",
      "    scheduler();\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "void threadFunction2() {\n",
      "    // Do some work\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The above example demonstrates a very primitive form of task switching but lacks true parallelism, preemptive multitasking, and most features you would expect from a real threading environment. Implementing a true multithreading environment without using any OS-provided libraries is fundamentally about interacting with OS and hardware specifics, which cannot be done in a purely standard C environment. This typically requires assembly language and deep integration with the operating system.\n"
